Project Title: Senior Shop – Accessibility-First E-Commerce
Team Name: [Your Team Name] Theme: Inclusive Shopping for the Elderly & Disabled

1. Problem Statement
The Challenge: Modern e-commerce platforms are often overwhelming for older adults and users with disabilities. Small touch targets, low-contrast text, hidden menus, and "timed" sessions create anxiety and barriers to independence.
Visual Decline: 1 in 3 seniors has vision-reducing eye disease.
Motor Control: Tremors make navigating complex dropdowns difficult.
Cognitive Load: Complex checkout flows lead to abandonment.
The Solution: Senior Shop is a specialized e-commerce interface designed with a "Accessibility-First" mindset. It prioritizes clarity, stability, and voice-assisted interaction to empower users to shop with dignity and independence.

2. Key Innovation: Assistive Tech Integration
Unlike standard websites that require users to bring their own tools (like screen readers), Senior Shop integrates assistive technology directly into the interface:
🗣️ Voice-First Navigation: Recognizing that typing is often difficult for seniors, we implemented a dedicated "Voice Command" feature. Users can speak commands like "Find Phones" or "Confirm Order" to navigate the site without keyboard input.
🔊 Built-in Read Aloud: A "Read Page" button uses the Web Speech API to read product details and receipts aloud, assisting users with low literacy or visual fatigue.
🧠 "Lived-Experience" Filters: Instead of technical specs (e.g., "4GB RAM"), our filters use natural language based on needs (e.g., "Needs Large Screen", "Needs Extra Loud Volume").

3. Alignment with WCAG 2.1 Guidelines
Our design strictly follows the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust):
Perceivable (Visual Access)
High Contrast Toggle: A global setting switches the site to a Yellow-on-Black (19:1 ratio) theme, exceeding the WCAG Level AAA requirement (7:1).
Dyslexia Support: A dedicated toggle switches all text to the OpenDyslexic font to aid users with learning disabilities.
Real-World Imagery: We use large, clear product images rather than abstract icons to reduce cognitive ambiguity.
Operable (Motor Access)
Target Size Compliance: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) are minimum 48x48px, exceeding the WCAG 2.5.5 (Target Size) recommendation of 44px.
Error Prevention: The checkout forms use autocomplete attributes and large input fields to prevent typing errors.
No Time Limits: We removed all session timers, allowing users to complete tasks at their own pace (WCAG 2.2.1).

4. Technical Feasibility & Design Quality
Tech Stack: The prototype is built on standard HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It uses the browser's native Web Speech API for voice features, ensuring it works on any modern device without installing plugins.
Design System:
Primary Color: Teal (#208090) – Chosen for its calming effect and high contrast against white.
Typography: Source Sans 3 – A humanist sans-serif chosen for its legibility and distinct letter shapes.
Feedback Loops: Every action provides immediate feedback (e.g., "✓ Added to Cart" button change), crucial for users with short-term memory loss.

5. Conclusion
Senior Shop is not just a simplified website; it is a dignity-focused tool. By combining high-contrast aesthetics with cutting-edge voice technology, we have created a platform where technology adapts to the user, not the other way around.
